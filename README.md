hello practice

1. git add (file name) OR git add . (adding ALL files)
2. git commit -m "(insert commit message here)" - finalising your changes

- this appears in commit history in github / gitlabs (enterprise)
- this is your history
- allows you to see who made what changes, and WHEN
- github / gitlabs don't know what changes you have made yet on your local machine - you need some way of letting github / gitlabs know what chaanges you did

3. git push

- this is how you let github / gitlabs know what changes you finalised on your computer
